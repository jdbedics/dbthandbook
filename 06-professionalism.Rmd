2.  Clinic Policy and Staff

* If anything seems to contradict supervision then discuss with Jamie.

3.	Computer etiquette
*	Log off from your computer and the recording system after each session.
* When writing notes, do not leave your computer unattended without logging off. 
* Do not email anything about your clients with other providers or your supervisor (even if you use initials).
