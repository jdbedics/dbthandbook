**History**

The DBT practicum at CLU began in 2010 with the purpose of providing doctoral students at CLU with advanced training in dialectical behavior therapy.  THE CLU-DBT training program was developed by Dr. Jamie Bedics in collaboration with the developer of DBT, Dr. Marsha Linehan, at the University of Washington. Dr. Linehan was awarded a training grant from that National Institute of Health to improve the dissemination of DBT at the graduate level. The vast majority of DBT practitioners have received their training in DBT post-licensure.  These courses and classes, are offered through <a  href="https://behavioraltech.org/">Behavioral Tech</a> from the Linehan Institute. Although the gold standard, these courses are costly and can be time consuming.  Cal Lutheran was one of the first sites to implement the gold standard of training provided by Dr. Linehan at the graduate level.  The courses provided by Dr. Bedics are those received directly from Dr. Linehan and the courses he participated in at the University of Washington and during his fellowship in Seattle, WA at the <a  href="http://ebtseattle.com/">Evidence Based Treatment Center of Seattle</a>.
