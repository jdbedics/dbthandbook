# Contact with Internal and External Providers

_General Information_: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your clients' records.  Please do not view records or discuss cases with other providers. 

## Conversations

It's a natural urge to want to dicuss clients in the clinic. Please avoid doing so with your team and will other clinicians.  The time for consultation is in supervision or on team. 

*General Tips*

* Do not leave titanium unattended in any work area.
* Do not look in files that are not assigned to you.
* If you uncover protected health information (PHI), then do your best to protect the information and alert staff.
* Do not talk about your clients with other providers.
* If someone asks you about a client say: _"Sorry, I can't talk about my clients without consulting my supervisor"_"

## Email and Printed material 

* Never include your clients name in an email.
* Do not discuss your client in any detail in an email or text message.  Instead, email or text that you'd like to talk about a client.
* Never take material relatd to the client outside of the office.

## Phone Conversations

When you call a client or if someone calls you about a client, you cannot confirm that you know the client without a release of information.

Someone calls you:
_"I hear your concern, I cannot confirm that someone is or is not a client in the clinic."_

You call the client and someone else picks up:
_"Hi. Is <client name> there? No, no message.  I'll try again.  I can't say who this is but thank you.  I'll try again"_

It's all incredibly awkward and is why it's best to establish phone contact rules at the first session.
