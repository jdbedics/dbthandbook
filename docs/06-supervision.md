# Supervision and DBT Team

## Individual Supervision

1. Have a written agenda for every supervision. Write it out *before* you come to supervision.
2. Be prepared to discuss every client. 
3. Have one video prepared for discussion (know the date and time) of the moment you want to discuss.
4. Please be on-time for supervision and wait in the Bell House reception area for Jamie to come and get you for supervision.

* You are required to have supervision every week. It's your responsibility to schedule your time with Jamie.

* If you're having phone supervsion then do not wait for Jamie to call. Call Jamie.

## DBT Team Meetings

1. Know your role for each week (i.e., leader, mindfulness, etc.).
3. If you miss team, you owe the team a repair!
4. Put yourself on the agenda for problem solving. Avoid updates!
5. Put yourself on the agenda for burnout at least once a semester.
6. Make an effort to contribute at least once to a discussion.

## Practicum Class

Doctoral students have a practicum class with faculty or staff.  The class can be very helpful in hearing and learning about alternative perpsectives and improving the overall care of our clients.  Please do the following:

    * Change identifying information which can include the exact nature of the primary problem or diagnosis.
    * Think of this class as additonal consultation.  Do not implement recommendations.  Instead, bring the advice to team for further consideration.
    * **Always** talk about your client as if they were present. 
    * Discuss with Jamie any concerns you have about the class.
