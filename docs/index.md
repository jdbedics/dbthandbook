Welcome to the DBT Practicum at CLU!  The following pages include procedures and tips for the successful completion of the practicum.

**History**

The DBT practicum at CLU began in 2010 with the purpose of providing doctoral students at CLU with advanced training in dialectical behavior therapy.  THE CLU-DBT training program was developed by Dr. Jamie Bedics and in collaboration with the developer of DBT, Dr. Marsha Linehan, at the University of Washington. 

The majority of DBT practitioners in the community have received their training post-licensure.  Trainings are provided through groups such as the <a  href="https://behavioraltech.org/">**Linehan Institute**</a>.  These represent the gold standard in DBT training.  At the same time, they are both costly and time consuming.  Dr. Linehan recognized this limitation and received a training grant from the National Institute of Health to develop methods for disseminating DBT at the graduate level.  Cal Lutheran was one of the first universities to implement DBT training based on this grant.  


**Pathways to learning DBT at CLU**

1. *Full DBT Practicum with Supervision* (min. 6-unit elective) - The most typical path is for interested students to take the two course electives (DBT Basics and Suicidology) during their second year of doctoral work while simultaneously being supervised by Dr. Bedics in their first practicum at CLU. Students often take the optional mindfulness course in the summer for an additional 3-unit elective and a total of 9-elective units. 

    * Two courses + Second Year Practicum with Dr. Bedics (6 students max per year)
    * Two courses + 3rd Year Practicum with Dr. Bedics (1 student per year)

2. *No practicum + Course Electives* - Students are free to take any of the courses offered by Dr. Bedics at anytime during their doctoral training at CLU without supervision and personal feedback on performance.

**What does the Full DBT Practicum involve?**

 II. Practicum Supervision with Dr. Bedics

Students in the DBT Practicum primarily conduct behavior therapy and see individual clients (adults and teens).  Students are more likely to be given clients who have reported recent suicidal behavior.  It is rare for a student to have a case for comprehensive DBT unless the student agrees to stay beyond their one year practicum or they are in their third year practicum.

Responsibilities include:
  
    1. Shadow Dr. Bedics conduct phone screenings and assessment for the DBT Clinic
    2. Participate in DBT Skills Training Class with Dr. Bedics and co-lead portions of the group (as available)
    3. Participate on DBT Team (Required)
    4. Learn how to evaluate sessions as being consistent or inconsistent with DBT (i.e., rate adherence)
    5. Conduct phone coaching with clients consistent with DBT principles (as needed)
