# Professionalism


1. Dress appropriately. Always check clinic standards.
*	Men: No need for a tie and jacket.
* Women: Dress below the knees or pant suits.  Modest tops. 
* Cover all tattoos regardless of size.

2.  Clinic Policy and Staff
* You are an employee of the clinic and are being evaluated based on your ability to be a good colleague.
* Treat the staff professionally.
* Know the rules and procedures of the clinic.
* If anything seems to contradict supervision then discuss with Jamie.

3.	Computer etiquette
*	Log off from your computer and the recording system.
* When writing notes, do not leave your computer unattended without logging off. 
* Do not email anything about your clients with other providers or your supervisor (even if you use initials).

    i.	For example, it’s common for a student to email/text their supervisor about client “SB” and provide a lengthy description of the circumstances.  
    ii.	Solution:  Email or text Jamie: “Do you have a moment to chat about a client”
