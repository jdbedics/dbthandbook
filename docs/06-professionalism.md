# Professionalism


1. Don’t talk about your clients with people who have no responsibility in the care of your client
* Avoid getting roped into “water cooler” talk.  It’s just best to not talk about clients outside of a formal setting
* Ask yourself, “Is this the appropriate setting to be talking about clients?”

2.	Dress appropriately.
*	Men, no need for a tie and jacket
* Cover all tattoos regardless of size etc.
* Women, dress below the knees or pant suits.  Modest tops. 

3.	Computer etiquette
*	Log off from your computer and the recording system.
* When writing notes, do not leave your computer unattended without logging off. 
* Do not email anything about your clients with other providers or your supervisor (even if you use initials).

i.	For example, it’s common for a student to email/text their supervisor about client “SB” and provide a lengthy description of the circumstances.  

ii.	Solution:  Email or text “Do you have a moment to chat about a client”
