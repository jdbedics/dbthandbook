# Individual Therapy Sessions

## General Clinic

Unless you're told otherwise by Dr. Bedics, all of your clients are general clinic clients and _not_ in DBT.  They are simply being seen under the umbrella of the DBT Clinic at CLU.  They are receiving behavioral therapy and you are being supervised in behavior therapy as you learned in Behavior Therapy (PSYD 745).

## General Procedures and professionalism

Your performance and evaluation in the practicum is largely a reflection of your professionalism. 

1. Be on time and end on time for all appointments.  This is easier said than done so do your best to be aware of time.
2. Be polite and respectful to all staff.
3. It's appropriate to consult.  A general rule is to only consult if you were comfortable with your client being present.
4. Call Dr. Bedics if you want to talk about a client anytime.  Avoid texting any information about client, including client name. 

## First Session Checklist

1. Review Jamie's Safety Planning **[Presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/jdbedics/clu-2018-community-counseling-safety-training)** before meeting with client.  Conduct safety planning as needed. 
    * Keep the *essential sheets* with you and ready for every session.

2. Checklist:

    * If not done already, set fee. Ask client to bring in proof of income.

    * Do not bring up or mention reduced fee option. If asked, ask the reason and tell them that you will talk to your supervisor.

    * If you're collecting the fee remember to always collect the fee at the beginning of session.

    * Remind them of 24-hour policy for missed sessions or they will be charged.  Charges occur regardless the reason. Tell them to call ahead if they have any reason to believe they will miss or are even slightly under the weather. 

    * Review confidentiality and privacy.  

    * Ask if they are hoping their records will be used for anything in the future or sent to any external person.

    * Ask if they would like for you to talk to someone important to them about their treatment.

    * Orient them to the OQ and help make it easy for them. 

    * Confirm the phone number on file and ask if you can leave a message on their phone if you have to call about logisitics.

    * Remind them that you start at the top of the hour and sessions last 45-minutes.  You can tell them that you manage time and will look at the clock and comment on time as you proceed.  The goal is to make sure they are getting what they want out of the session and are covering everything they intended to have covered.

    * Orient to behavior therapy.  Tell the client that you conduct short-term problem solving therapy.  Sessions range from 8-10 weeks.  The client can renew after the initial block of sessions.  You can validate that this is likely different from their expectations or therapy that they have had in the past. The first few sessions are unusual as they involve getting to know each other and the completion of the intake form.  After several sessions, you and client review progress and  agree on termination/renewal time.

    * Complete the DBT General Note and start drafting the treatment plan using the CLU template on Titanium.

Students should feel free to save this checklist as a PDF and print this page out for each new client. 

3. You're allowed to take written notes, use a clipboard, and write on the white board during all sessions. By default, use these methods sparingly and only as a means to help you engage the client in the spirit of problem solving. 

## Continuing Sessions

1. Set the recording up early.  Minimize the screen **and** turn the monitor off.
2. Do not start the session until your client completes the OQ.  
    * Help your client become successful at completing the OQ. Support and encourage and help them remember _how_ to do it. 
3. Review the OQ _prior_ to seeing your client. You shoud consider commenting on the OQ in the following situations:
    * High or Moderate distress with no change in status from baseline
    * Any note of an increase in a critical item 
    * Significant improvement from baseline

Review the OQ early in the session as it will be helpful in setting the agenda. It can also help clear up any misunderstandings that will result in invalid reports.  For example, make sure each client understands that they are rating the past week only.  In other situations, clients might respond carelessly.  The simple act of asking your client about the OQ shows its importance to you and is often corrective by itself.

4. You might have a therapist in the room before you that ends their sessions late.  Ask them if they plan on continuing to do that in the future.  If so, try to find another room.  If there is no other room, or you'd rather not have that option, talk to clinic staff, the clinic director, or Dr. Bedics.
5. Complete all notes within *one* week. 
6. Use the DBT General Note for individual sessions.  This is the standard note for your clients when you are supervised by Jamie. 

## Setting Goals

It is not your clients' job to come into session with goals.  Instead, listen to your clients' concerns and attempt to make them into solvable problems. You never have to use the term _goal_ or ever ask your client _What's you're goal_?  The goals naturally reveal themselves as you listen to clients' concerns. It is your job to rephrase their statements into something like:

    `It sounds like there are times when it's really hard for you to say no? Do you think that would be helpful for us to get our heads around and come up with some solutions?`

Dr. Bedics rarely uses the term _goal_, instead the therapists' job is to come up with tangible outcomes that can be demonstrated after 8-10 sessions.  These goals are fluid and always developing or being revised.  It is the therapists job to pay careful attention, keep the session organized, and maintain awareness of progress. The special DBT note requires that you are aware of each goal, assign HW to related to those goals, and then review the HW in the next session.

## Termination of Treatment

As a default, tell your client that you conduct short-term problem solving therapy.  Sessions last between 8-10 sessions with an option to renew.

* After 2-3 sessions, let your client know your plan for intervention along with a timeline for termination.
    * If you're not following an exact protocol then I often make a fairly aribtrary timeline.  For example, if we start on Sept 1st then I'll set a time to end right before Thanksgiving.  
* Let your client know that treatment will be reassessed at that point and could be extended if the client would like to address additional areas.
* When there is a a month left in treatment, remind the client every session that treatment is ending in order to focus your time. 
* In _DBT only_, discuss the concept of ex-therapist for life. 

## Missed Individual Sessions

1. If a client misses a session, call and leave a voicemail following the guidelines in the section on [phone contact](phone-contact-with-clients.html).
2. Write a note for all sessions, even canceled.  Be clear what you did as a result. See the section on [phone notes](phone-contact-with-clients.html).
