# Phone Contact with Clients

## Missed Session
If a client misses a session then call the client and leave a voicemail after 20-minutes of waiting. 
* Remind them of your session and the 24-hour cancellation rule.  They will have to pay for two sessions at their next individual.  
* This is _much_  easier if you told them this would happen at the first session.  
* Ask them to confirm within three days that they will attend the next session to avoid future fees if they cannot make that time. Provide your number.

* Never say the clinic in a phone message unless the client said it's okay.  
  * By default say â€œThis is < _therapist first name_ > calling.  We had an appointment at 11:00AM.  Since I did not hear from you in 24-hours, i wanted to remind you that you'll be charged with a miss session.  The next time that you come in you'll have to pay double."
  * You might add: "Please call to confirm your next appointment by Friday at 5PM. If I don't hear from you by that time then I'll assume you are no longer interested in treatment and I'll close your file.  You can always re-initiate treatment at anytime."
  * Write a note! For example:

*Client did not show for individual appointment.  Therapist called client and left a message for client to call and confirm the next appointment.  Therapist also informed client in message of late fee charged.  Next appoint is on DATE. Client was asked to call therapist by DATE at 5:PM to confirm next appointment to avoid any additional charges.*

##  You call the client but someone else picks up.
_"Hi. Is <*client name*> there? No, no message.  I'll try again.  I can't say who this is but thank you.  I'll try again."_

##  Someone calls (or emails) you about the client :
_"I hear your concern, I cannot confirm that someone is or is not a client in the clinic and so I cannot respond to your questions.  If you are concerned for safety, then I can provide general recommendations."_

## Phone Coaching as an intervention
Unless you have approval by Dr. Bedics for phone coaching in DBT, then you do not use the phone for anything but scheduling with your client.
