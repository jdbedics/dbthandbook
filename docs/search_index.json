They are simply being seen under the umbrella of the DBT Clinic. They are receiving behavior therapy. There will always be a client note for every scheduled contact hour and for every phone contact including scheduling. Start and end on time for everything. It helps to be prepared. 1.2 First Session Checklist Review Jamie’s Safety Planning Presentation before meeting with client. Conduct safety planning as needed. Always carry the essential sheets with you to every session. Checklist: Set fee. Ask client to bring in proof of income Do not bring up or mention reduced fee option. If asked, ask the reason and for how long they would expect to have the reduction. Tell them you will talk to your supervisor. Always collect Fee at the beginning of session. Remind them of 24-hour policy for missed sessions or they will be charged. Charges occur regardless the reason. If they have even a slightly itchy throat then they should cancel as early as possible. Review confidentiality and privacy. Ask if they are hoping their records will be used for anything in the future. Would they like for you to talk to someone important to them? Remind them they will complete the OQ before every session. Orient them and make sure they are set up with a userid and password. Help your client with this and they will have less difficulty completing it. Confirm the phone number on file and ask if you can leave a message on their phone if you have to call about logisitics. Remind them that you start at the top of the hour and sessions last 45-minutes. You can tell them that you manage time and will look at the clock and comment on time as you proceed. The goal is to make sure they are getting what they want out of the session and are covering everything they intended to have covered. Complete the DBT General Note. You’re allowed to take written notes, use a clipboard, and write on the white board. 1.3 Continuing Sessions Set the recording up early. Minimize the screen or turn the monitor off. Do not start the session until your client completes the OQ. Help your client become successful at completing the OQ. Support and encourage and help them remember how to do it. You might have a therapist in the room before you that ends their sessions late. Ask them if they plan on continuing to do that in the future. If so, try to find another room. If there is no other room, or you’d rather not have that option, talk to Jamie or clinic staff. Do not fall behind on your notes more than one week. Use the DBT General Note for individual sessions. This is the standard note for your clients when you are supervised by Jamie. 1.4 Missed Individual Sessions If a client misses a session, call and leave a voicemail. Write a note for all sessions, even canceled. Be clear what you did as a result. See the section on phone notes. 1.5 Setting Goals It is not your clients job to come into session with goals. Instead, listen to their concerns and attempt to make them into solvable problems. You never have to use the term goal or ask your client _“What’s you’re goal_? The goals naturally reveal themselves as you listen to what’s on your clients’ minds. 1.6 Termination of Treatment After 2-3 sessions, let your client know you’re plan for intervention along with a timeline. Establish a timeline for the end of the treatment. Treatment will be reassessed at that point and could be extended if client would like to address additional areas. When there is a a month left in treatment, remind the client every session that treatment is ending. In DBT only, discuss the concept of ex-therapist for life. 1.7 Any Concerns about Treatment, at all. Text or call Jamie is the safest and most appropriate thing that you can do. "],
["phone-contact-with-clients.html", "Section 2 Phone Contact with Clients 2.1 Missed Session 2.2 You call the client but someone else picks up. 2.3 Someone calls (or emails) you about the client : 2.4 Phone Coaching as an intervention", " Section 2 Phone Contact with Clients 2.1 Missed Session If a client misses a session then call the client and leave a voicemail after 20-minutes of waiting. * Remind them of your session and the 24-hour cancellation rule. They will have to pay for two sessions at their next individual. * This is much easier if you told them this would happen at the first session. * Ask them to confirm within three days that they will attend the next session to avoid future fees if they cannot make that time. Provide your number. Never say the clinic in a phone message unless the client said it’s okay. By default say “This is &lt; therapist first name &gt; calling. We had an appointment at 11:00AM. Since I did not hear from you in 24-hours, i wanted to remind you that you’ll be charged with a miss session. The next time that you come in you’ll have to pay double.” You might add: “Please call to confirm your next appointment by Friday at 5PM. If I don’t hear from you by that time then I’ll assume you are no longer interested in treatment and I’ll close your file. You can always re-initiate treatment at anytime.” Write a note! For example: Client did not show for individual appointment. Therapist called client and left a message for client to call and confirm the next appointment. Therapist also informed client in message of late fee charged. Next appoint is on DATE. Client was asked to call therapist by DATE at 5:PM to confirm next appointment to avoid any additional charges. 2.2 You call the client but someone else picks up. “Hi. Is &lt;client name&gt; there? No, no message. I’ll try again. I can’t say who this is but thank you. I’ll try again.” 2.3 Someone calls (or emails) you about the client : “I hear your concern, I cannot confirm that someone is or is not a client in the clinic and so I cannot respond to your questions. If you are concerned for safety, then I can provide general recommendations.” 2.4 Phone Coaching as an intervention Unless you have approval by Dr. Bedics for phone coaching in DBT, then you do not use the phone for anything but scheduling with your client.

Please do not view records or discuss cases with other providers who are not associated with the case. General Tips Do not leave titanium unattended in any work area. Do not look in files that are not assigned to you. If you uncover protected health information (PHI), then do your best to protect the information and alert staff. Turn Panopto off after each session. 3.2 Conversations in the Clinic (Water Cooler Talk) It’s a natural urge to want to dicuss clients in the clinic especially if your anxious. Please avoid doing so and you’ll be noticed in a good way. The time for consultation is in supervision or on team. Consultation should be well thought out and purposively planned with a specific goal in mind. Check with Jamie if you have any concerns. If someone asks you about a client say: “Sorry, I can’t talk about my clients without consulting my supervisor”&quot; Do this by default. It’s best to be overly cautious. 3.3 Email and Printed material Never include your client’s name in an email. Do not discuss your client in any detail in an email or text message even if de-identified. Instead, email or text that you’d like to talk about a client. Never take material relatd to the client outside of the office. 3.4 Client Requests that you Talk to other people (provider, family, etc.) Say, okay, and that you need to talk to your supervisor to confirm the procedures. Ask yourself what is the reason for the contact. What purpose would it serve? If you complete a release of information, specify what exactly you’d like to have accomplished and by what day/time. Always make clear that the release will expire after: A certain goal is accomplished and/or A certain time has passed by. "],

In-Class Demonstrations Homework Assignments Random Tips 4.2.1 Distress Tolerance 4.2.1.1 Handout DT1: Goals Survive Crisis Situations Backstory: In the urgency of the moment, we want to solve the problem. At the same time, in solving the problem we are vulnerable to saying or doing things that we could regret or make things worse. Highlights that the problem is valid. You’re upset for a reason. When we try to solve problems in an emotional state what can happen? Problem remains with additional problems to solve.

Write it out before you come to supervision. Cover every client even if it’s an update. Do not make them all updates. Have one video prepared for discussion (know the date and time) You are required to have supervision every week and it’s your responsibility to schedule it with Jamie. If you’re having phone supervsion, do not wait for Jamie to call. Call Jamie. 5.2 DBT Team Meetings Keep an updated schedule for every team so that you know you’re role for that week. Be on time! If you miss team, you owe the team a repair! Put yourself on the agenda for problem solving and come prepared with a question each week (even though Jamie answered everything in supervision) Put yourself on the agenda for burnout at least once a semester.

["professionalism.html", "Section 6 Professionalism", " Section 6 Professionalism Dress appropriately. Always check clinic standards. Men: No need for a tie and jacket. Women: Dress below the knees or pant suits. Modest tops. Cover all tattoos regardless of size. Clinic Policy and Staff You are an employee of the clinic and are being evaluated based on your ability to be a good colleague. Treat the staff professionally. Know the rules and procedures of the clinic. If anything seems to contradict supervision then discuss with Jamie. Computer etiquette Log off from your computer and the recording system. When writing notes, do not leave your computer unattended without logging off. Do not email anything about your clients with other providers or your supervisor (even if you use initials). For example, it’s common for a student to email/text their supervisor about client “SB” and provide a lengthy description of the circumstances. Solution: Email or text Jamie: “Do you have a moment to chat about a client” "]
