Welcome to the DBT Practicum at CLU! The following pages include procedures and tips for the successful completion of the practicum. History The DBT practicum at CLU began in 2010 with the purpose of providing doctoral students with advanced training in dialectical behavior therapy. THE CLU-DBT training program was developed by Dr. Jamie Bedics in collaboration with the developer of DBT, Dr. Marsha Linehan, at the University of Washington. The vast majority of DBT practitioners in the community have received their training post-licensure. These classes, offered through the Linehan Institute, are the gold standard in DBT training but are both costly and time consuming. Dr. Linehan recognized this limitation and received a training grant from the National Institute of Health to develop methods for disseminating DBT at the graduate level. Cal Lutheran was one of the first universities to implement DBT training at the graduate level based on this work. What does the DBT Practicum involve? I. DBT Coursework 1. Behavioral Therapy (PSYD Required Spring of first year) 2. DBT Basics (Fall Semester) 3. Suicide Assessment and Crisis Management (Spring Semester) 4. Mindfulness (every other summer) 5. DBT Skills Training (summer) Course descriptions can be found at the Cal Lutheran Website. Mindfulness Silent Retreat 2018 in Malibu, CA Mindfulness Silent Retreat 2017 in Santa Barbara, CA Practicum Supervision with Dr. Bedics Students in the DBT Practicum primarily conduct behavior therapy and see individual (adults and teens), couples, or families from the general clinic. Students in the DBT practicum are, however, more likely to be given clients who have reported recent suicidal behavior. It is rare for a student to have a case for comprehensive DBT unless the student agrees to stay beyond their one year practicum. When you are learning behavior therapy, you are learning DBT. However, DBT is more than traditional behavior therapy. In terms of DBT specific training, students can: 1. Shadow Dr. Bedics conduct phone screenings and assessment for the DBT Clinic 2. Participate in DBT Skills Training Class with Dr. Bedics and co-lead portions of the group 3. Participate on DBT Team (Required) 4. Learn how to evaluate sessions as being consistent or inconsistent with DBT (i.e., rate adherence) 5. Conduct phone coaching with clients consistent with DBT principles Pathways to learning DBT at CLU Full DBT Practicum with Supervision (min. 6-unit elective) - The most typical path is for interested students to take the two course electives (DBT Basics and Suicidology) during their second year of doctoral work while simultaneously being supervised by Dr. Bedics in their first practicum at CLU. Students often take the optional mindfulness course in the summer for an additional 3-unit elective and a total of 9 elective units. It is less common but students can apply to take the practicum in their 3rd or 4th year of training. The Full DBT Practicum requires students to take the Fall DBT Basics class and the Spring Suicide class. Course Electives (no supervision) - Students are free to take any of the courses offered by Dr. Bedics at anytime during their doctoral training at CLU without supervision and personal feedback on performance. Application process for the Full DBT Practicum Students at CLU can apply for the DBT practicum during the second semester of their first year in the doctoral program. Requirements including the following: Approval by their academic advisor in the doctoral program to take elective courses in their second year. Approval by the Director of Clinical Training in the doctoral program. Good academic standing. Successful completion of the course in Behavioral Therapy (PSYD745) with a passing grade and the following: Demonstrated a high degree of professionalism (e.g., being on time to class). Clearly engaged in the material and participated in a professional manner. Demonstrated a high degree of conscientiousness in completing assignments. Talk to a current DBT Practicum student about the challenges and benefits of taking DBT. A final interview with Dr. Bedics following the applicant having met all of the above requirements and having read this manual. "],
["dbt-coursework.html", "Section 1 DBT Coursework", " Section 1 DBT Coursework Points to Consider The readings are extensive and for most students this course is an elective on top of a full-time schedule. Students should be prepared to complete the readings and adjust their time accordingly. In addition, students are provided with a great deal of autonomy. In other words, you get out of the course what you put into it. At the same time, Dr. Bedics will notice when books are not underlined and students are not engaged in the material at the graduate level. A poor performance, lack of participation and engagement in the class are often reflected in poor letters of recommendation or students simply not requesting a letter of recommendation. The majority of students do not receive an A in DBT courses. An A requires exceptional work across all assignments with the heaviest weight being placed on the final paper, presentation, and exam. Students who perform best are preparing for their final paper and presentation throughout the semester and not at the end of the semester. All courses are offered on the Thousand Oaks Campus at the Bell House (Graduate Psychology). The DBT Basics and Suicide courses start at 9AM on Wednesday and end at 11:50AM. DBT Team follows from noon until 2PM. All supervision is also in Thousand Oaks at times that fit with Dr. Bedics’ schedule. Students have to adjust their schedule accordingly so they are on time (ideally early) for all appointments. The Bell House - Graduate Psychology "],
["commitment-to-dbt-practicum.html", "Section 2 Commitment to DBT Practicum", " Section 2 Commitment to DBT Practicum Joining Team All new members to a DBT Team need to have a commitment session. This is true even if someone used to be on team but is re-entering. Often, the last person committed commits the newest member. The primary commitment is to be on the team and to participate in the training - do your very best to learn DBT. To keep the agreements of the team, especially remaining dialectical. Willing to ask the team for permission when you want to go out of town. Willing to stay in town if your client is in acute state of crisis and it is not in the best interest of the client for you to leave town. Call out “elephants in the room.” Be willing to give clinical advice to people that have more experience than you (including your supervisor). Function as a therapist in the group (to the group) and not just be a silent observer or a person that only speaks about their own problems. To have the humility to admit your mistakes/difficulties and the willingness to have the group help you solve them. To be nonjudgmental and compassionate of your fellow clinicians and clients. To ring the bell of nonjudgmentalness to remind yourself to not be judgmental. The bell is a reminder and not a sensor. To properly assess the problem before giving solutions. To be willing to go through a chain analysis even though you were only 31 seconds late and you would have been there on time if it wasn’t for those traffic lights on Lynn or the parking around the Bell House. Show up on time or call. If you feel that the consult team is not being useful or you don’t like the way it is being run, to say something about it rather than silently stewing in frustration. Be prepared to feel burnt out, frustrated, tired, overworked, underappreciated, hopeless, ineffective and yet - to carry on (easier committed than done, of course). Participate in team by doing the roles of Leader, Observer, Note Taker, Mindfulness and Phones. No one can be on team and be unavailable to see a patient. Know your limits and also be flexible. Be willing to be responsible for the outcomes of ALL clients on the team; agree that if a client seen by any therapist on the team dies by suicide, you will always say “yes” when asked if you have ever had a client die by suicide. Note that this is not a minor responsibility to worry about the other therapists and clients on the team; in a way to function as a supervisor as well. The best question to ask the other team members is “What experiences have you had that seriously tested your commitment to the team and how on Earth and why on Earth did you still keep your commitment?” Willing to be on call 24/7 for your clients in comprehensive DBT only. Willing to not miss more than 2 weeks of therapy with an individual comprehensive DBT client during the entire practicum. A person may not stop being on the team while they have a comprehensive DBT client. Watching videos of skills class is part of the practicum and not part of team. Complete all the readings for DBT related coursework and be an active participant in all classes. "],
["individual-therapy-sessions.html", "Section 3 Individual Therapy Sessions 3.1 General Clinic 3.2 General Procedures and Professionalism 3.3 First Session Checklist 3.4 Continuing Sessions 3.5 Setting Goals 3.6 Termination of Treatment 3.7 Missed Individual Sessions 3.8 Call or text Jamie", " Section 3 Individual Therapy Sessions 3.1 General Clinic Unless you’re told otherwise by Dr. Bedics, all of your clients are general clinic clients and not in DBT. They are simply being seen under the umbrella of the DBT Clinic at CLU. They are receiving behavioral therapy and you are being supervised in behavior therapy as you learned in Behavior Therapy (PSYD 745). 3.2 General Procedures and Professionalism Your performance and evaluation in the practicum is largely a reflection of your professionalism. Be on time and end on time for all appointments. This is easier said than done so do your best to be aware of time. Be polite and respectful to all staff. It’s appropriate to consult. A general rule is to consult and talk about your client as if the client and Dr. Bedics were present. Feel free to call Dr. Bedics to dicuss your cases at anytime. Simply text Dr. Bedics that you would like to talk but do not include a client name or information. 3.3 First Session Checklist Review Jamie’s Suicide Training Presentation before meeting with clients and be prepared to conduct safety planning as needed. Keep the essential sheets with you and ready for every session. Checklist: I recommend printing this page our and bringing with you to the first session. Check the list off as you accomplish each task. Welcome the client and orient them to the uniqueness of the structure of the day (See Suicide Training Presentation) Remind client that they are being recorded and that the only person to see the tape is your supervisor. Review confidentiality and privacy. Establish the fee and ask the client to bring in proof of income. Do not bring up or mention a reduced fee option. If asked about a reduced fee then ask the reason and tell them that you will talk to your supervisor and clinic director. If they are a transfer client than review their existing fee. If it is below the minimum, then ask them the reason. Discuss on team. Remind them of 24-hour policy for missed sessions or they will be charged. Charges occur regardless the reason. Tell them to call ahead if they have any reason to believe they will miss or are even slightly under the weather. It is best to be cautious to avoid the automatic charge. Ask if they are hoping their records will be used for anything in the future or sent to any external person. Ask if they would like for you to talk to someone important to them about their treatment. Orient them to the OQ and answer their questions. Confirm the phone number on file and ask if you can leave a message on their phone if you have to call about logisitics. Remind them that you start at the top of the hour and sessions last 45-minutes. You can tell them that you manage time and will look at the clock and comment on time as you proceed. The goal is to make sure they are getting what they want out of the session and are covering everything they intended to have covered. Orient to behavior therapy. Tell the client that you conduct short-term problem solving therapy. Sessions range from 8-10 weeks. The client can renew after the initial block of sessions. You can validate that this is likely different from their expectations or therapy that they have had in the past. The first few sessions are unusual as they involve getting to know each other and the completion of the intake form. After several sessions, you and client review progress and agree on termination/renewal time. Complete the DBT General Note and start drafting the treatment plan using the CLU template on Titanium. Students should feel free to save this checklist as a PDF and print this page out for each new client. You’re allowed to take written notes, use a clipboard, and write on the white board during all sessions. By default, use these methods sparingly and only as a means to help you engage the client in the spirit of problem solving. 3.4 Continuing Sessions Set the recording up early. Minimize the screen and turn the monitor off. Review the OQ prior to seeing your client. You shoud consider commenting on the OQ in the following situations: High or Moderate distress with no change in status from baseline Any note of an increase in a critical item Significant improvement from baseline Set a collaborative agenda. Comment on the OQ in doing so. The simple act of asking your client about the OQ shows its importance to you and is often corrective by itself. You might have a therapist in the room before you that ends their sessions late. If that’s the case, simply ask them if they plan on continuing to do that in the future. If so, try to find another room. If there is no other room, or you’d rather not have that option, talk to clinic staff, the clinic director, or Dr. Bedics. Complete all notes within one week. Use the DBT General Note for individual sessions. This is the standard note for your clients when you are supervised by Jamie. 3.5 Setting Goals Creating solvable problems from your clients’ stated concerns is one of the most important and challenging parts of conducting treatment. Further, this is an ongoing process that does not end with the first few sessions. The best mindset a therapist can have is to always ask “What does my client need?” or “What would have to be different for my client to create the life they want for themselves?” These are hard questions for anybody to answer about themselves. You will help the client by modeling how to reframe your clients’ concerns in a solvable manner. Inevitably, this well help lead to realistic change which will likely also involve some distress tolerance around what cannot be changed in their lives. Lastly, you never have to use the term goal or ever ask your client What’s you’re goal? The goals naturally reveal themselves as you listen to clients’ concerns. It is your job to rephrase their statements into something like: `It sounds like there are times when it&#39;s really hard for you to say no? Do you think that would be helpful for us to get our heads around and come up with some solutions?` The therapist is then responsible for following up and revising during the course of treatment. 3.6 Termination of Treatment As a default, tell your client that you conduct short-term problem solving therapy. Sessions last between 8-10 sessions with an option to renew. After 2-3 sessions, let your client know your plan for intervention along with a timeline for termination. If you’re not following an exact protocol then I often make a fairly aribtrary timeline. For example, if we start on Sept 1st then I’ll set a time to end right before Thanksgiving. Let your client know that treatment will be reassessed at that point and could be extended if the client would like to address additional areas. When there is a a month left in treatment, remind the client every session that treatment is ending in order to focus your time. In DBT only, discuss the concept of ex-therapist for life. 3.7 Missed Individual Sessions If a client misses a session, call and leave a voicemail following the guidelines in the section on phone contact. Write a note for all sessions, even canceled. Be clear what you did as a result. See the section on phone notes. 3.8 Call or text Jamie Please do not hesitate to text Jamie to discuss a case. Do not include any identifying information in the text. "],
["dbt-skills-training-class.html", "Section 4 DBT Skills Training Class 4.1 General Requirements 4.2 Jamie’s Tips for Skills Training 4.3 Group Notes", " Section 4 DBT Skills Training Class 4.1 General Requirements Participating in the DBT Skills Class with Jamie is a privilege. There is limited availability and it will add significantly to your workload. Below are the pre-requisites and responsiblities for participation in the skills class. 4.1.0.1 Prerequisites for any DBT student interested in participating in DBT Skills Class Purchase the DBT Skills Training Manual along with DBT Skills Training Handout and Worksheets. Read Part 1 (chapters 1-5) in the DBT Skills Training Manual. Based on your highlighting of the text, develop five questions each that you think would be critical for any DBT Skills Trainer to know. Go to the CLU DBT Google Drive and contribute to the document called Skills Discussion Questions in the Skills Training Folder. Meet as a group or, at minimum, in pairs to discuss the material and answer the questions each member developed. Continue this process for the first five chapters of the training manual. 4.1.0.2 Google Drive for More Tips The Google Drive folder has additional tips for each module located in Skills Training and Jamie's Tips. 4.1.0.3 Responsibilities At any given time, a total of three students can participate in the Monday night Skills Class with Jamie. One student is a co-leader, one student is a note-taker, and the last student is an observer. Co-leaders conduct mindfulness. Each week prepare a mindfulness that is emailed to Jamie by Sunday at 5:PM. Co-leaders write a practice agenda for the teaching portion of the class. You’ll be required to outline and submit a practice agenda based on your reading of the teaching manual. Co-leaders check on late clients and call clients who missed class with the exact HW from the week. Only the leader and co-leader participate and speak in class. The note-taker writes all the group notes (a single group note for the entire group and individual group notes for each participant). All student therapists complete the CLU DBT Skills Training Adherence Checklist. 4.2 Jamie’s Tips for Skills Training The following are general tips for the overall running of the DBT Skills Class. Specific tips for each module is located in the Google Drive. 4.2.1 General Tips If you purchased the books, the handouts and worksheets on PDF can be retreived at: Guilford Press. You’ll have to register with Guilford but it’s free. Managing time and setting the frame is important. Do your best to start and stop on time and make those decisions clear to the group prior to clients entering group. Be sure to let clients know that if they are late for class they are to wait in the waiting room and we will come and get them after mindfulness (~10-minutes into class) and after HW review (~40-Minutes into class) We often have snacks at break. Twizzlers, pretzels, and tea for some reason. Obviously this is optional. 4.2.2 Mindfulness Tips (5-10 Minutes) Be a leader of mindfulness. This means practice beforehand, have your script ready, and be confident and clear when you teach. Tell a story. Example: “I like hiking and this past weekend I was out for a hike on Mt. Hood. My friend came with me and really loves trees. I never noticed the differences between a Doug Fir, Cedar, or Spruce and had fun picking them out.” Have a clear objective. Example: “Today, I brought in pictures of a Doug Fir, Cedar, and Spruce. I’m going to pass them out and I want you to use your describe skills to notice and jot down any differences you see.” Remind about gentleness towards oneself. Example: “You may notice your mind wander to other areas of your life or to your neighbor. Do your best to notice that and come back to your task. The mind will wander. The best we can do is notice and bring it back to our goal. Make sense? Any questions?” Pro Tip: Do not pass out material unti you’re done with the instructions. They’ll be distracted! Ring bell and check-in. Example: “How was that?” “Did you notice your mind wander? Were you able to bring it back?” Don’t make it therapy. Move people along. Co-leader and Leader share too. Leader shares last. Leader: Resist the urge to comment on how it’s challenging to lead mindfulness while at the same time doing mindfulness. You could do this every session if you really think about it. 4.2.3 Practice (HW) Review Portion of Class Remind class what the practice was from last week. Ask for a volunteer to start. If Client did not complete practice: Complete a Missing Links Analysis (General Handout 8) Did you know what to do when you left? If yes, then proceed to next. When you left, did you plan doing it? If yes, then proceed to next. Did you remember? If yes, then proceed to next. What happened when you remembered? Does not have to be an aversive affair. Just see if you can figure out with some curiosity, interest, what got in the way. Ask if they used other skills they found helpful. I do this to find something to support and encourage. Be careful not to overly reinforce them. Always Try and Do the Following: Be behaviorally specific by highlighting thoughts, feelings, behaviors, or bodily senations Manage time. Know your stopping point. Co-leader can help. Keep an ear open for any practice that could lead to a discussion of destructive behavior. I say things such as: “Hold on one second, just checking but is this something that you can share with the group?” I sometimes start off practice (HW Review) with a reminder by saying: “Anybody have any practice that they want to share and that’s appropriate to share with the group?” The same can be said if a parent or kid starts to share about the other the party. You can say: “Hold on, This sounds like it’s about &lt;other person in room&gt;. Generally we avoid that in class. &lt;Other Person&gt;, do you know about this and is this okay for them to share? Generally, we want to avoid practice involving other people.” Common problems to keep an eye out for include: * Clients practice their skills in high SUDS situtations only * Clients do not write down their assignments High SUDs: Remind clients at the end of every class that they are to practice in low SUDs situations so they can master the skill first prior to using them in the most important situations in their lives. Improve HW Compliance: Give yourself enough time to help clients start the assignments at the end of class. 4.2.4 Teaching Portion of Class Orient Group to Handout: “Okay group, turn to Handout ##” Co-leader can walk around and make sure everyone is okay Provide a rationale for why clients would benefit from learning the skill. Typically done by connecting how the biosocial model fits with the skill being taught. “Have you ever noticed that…” Always have at least on hands-on practice in class and have multiple examples ready to go. Here’s where you can be creative and do your thing. The DBT Teaching Manual has great examples. Be behaviorally specific throughout When you validate, pay attention to the thought, feeling, or behavior and name it as such. Same when you make a correction. Give yourself enought time to assign HW. Know and plan to end with enough time to adequately cover HW and to troubleshoot what can get in the way. Ideally, get them started. “What is your plan?” “What can get in they way? I know you sometimes struggle to remember with your busy schedule. How will you manage that this week?” 4.2.5 Observations (Final 5-minutes) If the day was busy, chaotic, you can end with something relaxing or help them prepare for what to do after session Depending on class, you can give this 10-minutes if you really want to emphasize self-care after group Called a wrap around procedure. In the absence of problems we do observations: “Okay group, observations.” Clients can observe they were tired or that you’re wearing a blue shirt, etc. Leader goes last and should try to say something supportive or encouraging about the group as a whole. Something more “yoda” like than what we expect from the clients. 4.3 Group Notes Please follow these instructions for completing the DBT Skills Group note. Two separate groups notes are required in Titanium for the DBT Skills Group. Part I. Create and Distribute Go to your task list and click on DBT Group Note. Follow the template to fill out the note. Once you have completed the note, click “save”. Next, select “distribute” on the top right of the note menu. Select the option to distribute the note to all clients in the skills class. Part II. Create and Compose Individual Note Go back to your task list. There should be additional tasks that have been created for each group member. Click on the client’s note to open-up the task. The note that opens-up should be the previously entered group note that has now been attached or distributed to the individual client’s file. In the “Note Type” bar, select “DBT Individual Group Note”. Titanium will ask if you would like to insert the new template. Select “Yes”. The template for the Individual Group Note will now appear above the previously entered DBT Group Note. Add the group co-leader’s name following the “&amp;” symbol on the second line and complete the template. After completing the template (top portion) add the date of the next appointment. Press “Enter” to move down the portion of the Group Note starting with “Session Date” Add ************ between the Group Note and the Individual Note so it is clear where the Individual Group Note ends and the Group note begins. Sign each completed note individually and send to Dr. Bedics Part III. Remove Original Group Note Once you have confirmed each DBT Individual Group Note contains both the DBT Group Note and the Individual Group Note write up, go back into you task list and open-up the original DBT Group Note. Click ok on the box that pops up stating it is the original group note that has been distributed to the group members Click the “save” button on the top left of the note, then click the “delete” button. Confirm you would like to delete the note by clicking “yes” in the box that appears. Thanks to Andre for putting this together! "],

Do not say the name of the clinic in the phone message unless the client confirmed that it’s okay to do so at the initial meeting. Instead, by default say something like: “This is &lt; _you first name_ &gt; calling. We had an appointment at 11:00AM. Since I didn't hear from you in 24-hours, I wanted to remind you that you'll be charged for the missed session. I just didn't want you to be surprised the next time you come since you'll being paying for two sessions. Let me know if you have any concerns.&quot; If the client has consistently not shown then you you might add the following but check with Jamie first. &quot;Please call to confirm your next appointment by Friday at 5PM. If I don't hear from you by that time then I'll assume you are no longer interested in treatment and I'll close your file. You can always re-initiate treatment at anytime.&quot; Write a note! Can be a simple note and not the DBT General Note. For example: Client did not show for individual appointment. Therapist called client and left a message for client to call and confirm the next appointment. Therapist also informed client in message of late fee charged. Next appoint is on DATE. Client was asked to call therapist by DATE at 5:PM to confirm next appointment to avoid any additional charges. 5.2 You call the client but someone else picks up. &quot;Hi. Is &lt;*client name*&gt; there? No, no message. I'll try again. I can't say who this is but thank you. I'll try again.&quot; 5.3 Someone calls (or emails) you about the client : &quot;I hear your concern, I cannot confirm that someone is or is not a client in the clinic and so I cannot respond to your questions. If you are concerned for safety, then I can provide general recommendations.&quot; 5.4 Phone Coaching as an intervention Unless you have approval by Dr. Bedics for phone coaching in DBT, then you do not use the phone for anything but scheduling with your client.
