["individual-therapy-sessions.html", "Section 1 Individual Therapy Sessions 1.1 General Points 1.2 First Session Checklist 1.3 Continuing Sessions 1.4 Missed Individual Sessions 1.5 Setting Goals 1.6 Termination of Treatment 1.7 Call or text Jamie", " Section 1 Individual Therapy Sessions 1.1 General Points Unless you’re told otherwise by Jamie, all of your clients are general clinic clients and not in DBT. They are simply being seen under the umbrella of the DBT Clinic at CLU. They are receiving behavioral therapy. 1.2 First Session Checklist Review Jamie’s Safety Planning Presentation before meeting with client. Conduct safety planning as needed. Always carry the essential sheets with you to every session. Checklist: If not done already, set fee. Ask client to bring in proof of income. Do not bring up or mention reduced fee option. If asked, ask the reason and tell them that you will talk to your supervisor. If you’re collecting the fee remember to always collect the fee at the beginning of session. Remind them of 24-hour policy for missed sessions or they will be charged. Charges occur regardless the reason. I often tell them if they have any reason to believe they will miss then call and cancel. Review confidentiality and privacy. Ask if they are hoping their records will be used for anything in the future. Ask if they would like for you to talk to someone important to them about their treatment. Orient them to the OQ and help make it easy for them. Confirm the phone number on file and ask if you can leave a message on their phone if you have to call about logisitics. Remind them that you start at the top of the hour and sessions last 45-minutes. You can tell them that you manage time and will look at the clock and comment on time as you proceed. The goal is to make sure they are getting what they want out of the session and are covering everything they intended to have covered. Complete the DBT General Note and start drafting the treatment plan using the CLU template on Titanium. You’re allowed to take written notes, use a clipboard, and write on the white board during all sessions. 1.3 Continuing Sessions Set the recording up early. Minimize the screen or turn the monitor off. Do not start the session until your client completes the OQ. Help your client become successful at completing the OQ. Support and encourage and help them remember how to do it. You might have a therapist in the room before you that ends their sessions late. Ask them if they plan on continuing to do that in the future. If so, try to find another room. If there is no other room, or you’d rather not have that option, talk to Jamie or clinic staff. Complete all notes within one week. Use the DBT General Note for individual sessions. This is the standard note for your clients when you are supervised by Jamie. 1.4 Missed Individual Sessions If a client misses a session, call and leave a voicemail following the guidelines in the section on phone contact. Write a note for all sessions, even canceled. Be clear what you did as a result. See the section on phone notes. 1.5 Setting Goals It is not your clients job to come into session with goals. Instead, listen to your clients’ concerns and attempt to make them into solvable problems. You never have to use the term goal or ever ask your client What’s you’re goal? The goals naturally reveal themselves as you listen to what’s on your clients’ minds. It’s your job to rephrase their statements into something like: `It sounds like there are times when it&#39;s really hard for you to say no? Do you think that would be helpful for us to get our heads around and come up with some solutions?` 1.6 Termination of Treatment After 2-3 sessions, let your client know you’re plan for intervention along with a timeline for termination. If you’re not following an exact protocol then I often make a fairly aribtrary timeline. For example, if we start on Sept 1st then I’ll set a time to end right before Thanksgiving. Let your client know that treatment will be reassessed at that point and could be extended if the client would like to address additional areas. When there is a a month left in treatment, remind the client every session that treatment is ending in order to focus your time. In DBT only, discuss the concept of ex-therapist for life. 1.7 Call or text Jamie Please do not hesitate to call or text Jamie with any concerns or questions. "],
["phone-contact-with-clients.html", "Section 2 Phone Contact with Clients 2.1 Missed Session 2.2 You call the client but someone else picks up. 2.3 Someone calls (or emails) you about the client : 2.4 Phone Coaching as an intervention", " Section 2 Phone Contact with Clients 2.1 Missed Session If a client misses a session then call the client and leave a voicemail after 20-minutes of waiting. Do not say the name of the clinic in the phone message unless the client confirmed that it’s okay to do so at the initial meeting. Instead, by default say something like: “This is &lt; _you first name_ &gt; calling. We had an appointment at 11:00AM. Since I didn't hear from you in 24-hours, I wanted to remind you that you'll be charged for the missed session. I just didn't want you to be surprised the next time you come since you'll being paying for two sessions. Let me know if you have any concerns.&quot; If the client has consistently not shown then you you might add the following but check with Jamie first. &quot;Please call to confirm your next appointment by Friday at 5PM. If I don't hear from you by that time then I'll assume you are no longer interested in treatment and I'll close your file. You can always re-initiate treatment at anytime.&quot; Write a note! Can be a simple note and not the DBT General Note. For example: Client did not show for individual appointment. Therapist called client and left a message for client to call and confirm the next appointment. Therapist also informed client in message of late fee charged. Next appoint is on DATE. Client was asked to call therapist by DATE at 5:PM to confirm next appointment to avoid any additional charges. 2.2 You call the client but someone else picks up. &quot;Hi. Is &lt;*client name*&gt; there? No, no message. I'll try again. I can't say who this is but thank you. I'll try again.&quot; 2.3 Someone calls (or emails) you about the client : &quot;I hear your concern, I cannot confirm that someone is or is not a client in the clinic and so I cannot respond to your questions. If you are concerned for safety, then I can provide general recommendations.&quot; 2.4 Phone Coaching as an intervention Unless you have approval by Dr. Bedics for phone coaching in DBT, then you do not use the phone for anything but scheduling with your client.

["contact-with-providersfamily.html", "Section 3 Contact with Providers/Family 3.1 General Information 3.2 Conversations in the Clinic (Water Cooler Talk) 3.3 Email and Printed material 3.4 Client Requests that you talk to other people (provider, family, etc.)", " Section 3 Contact with Providers/Family 3.1 General Information You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your clients’ records. Please do not view records or discuss cases with other providers who are not associated with the case. General Tips Do not leave titanium unattended in any work area. Do not look in files that are not assigned to you. If you uncover protected health information (PHI), then do your best to protect the information and alert staff. Turn off Panopto after each session. 3.2 Conversations in the Clinic (Water Cooler Talk) It’s a natural urge to want to dicuss clients in the clinic especially if you’re anxious. Please avoid doing so and you’ll be noticed in a good way. The time for consultation is in supervision or on team. Consultation should be well thought out and purposively planned with a specific goal in mind. Check with Jamie if you have any concerns. If someone asks you about a client say: “Sorry, I can’t talk about my clients without consulting my supervisor” Do this by default. It’s best to be overly cautious. 3.3 Email and Printed material Never include your client’s name in an email. Do not discuss your client in any detail in an email or text message even if de-identified. Instead, email or text: &quot;I'd like to talk about a client. Do you have time? Never take material related to the client outside of the office. 3.4 Client Requests that you talk to other people (provider, family, etc.) Say okay and that you need to talk to your supervisor to confirm the procedures. Ask yourself what is the reason for the contact. What purpose would it serve? If you complete a release of information, specify what exactly you’d like to have accomplished and by what day/time. Keep in mind that cleints are not used to such formality. They just want you to talk to someone. However, that is not always in their best interest. Always make clear that the release will expire after: A certain goal is accomplished and/or A certain time has passed by. "],
["dbt-skills-training-class.html", "Section 4 DBT Skills Training Class 4.1 General Requirements 4.2 Jamie’s Tips for Skills Training", " Section 4 DBT Skills Training Class 4.1 General Requirements Participating in the DBT Skills Class with Jamie is a privilege. There is limited availability and it will add significantly to your workload. Below are the pre-requisites and responsiblities for participation in the skills class. 4.1.0.1 Prerequisites for any DBT student interested in participating in DBT Skills Class Purchase the DBT Skills Training Manual along with DBT Skills Training Handout and Worksheets. Read Part 1 (chapters 1-5) in the DBT Skills Training Manual. Based on your highlighting of the text, develop five questions each that you think would be critical for any DBT Skills Trainer to know. Go to the CLU DBT Google Drive and contribute to the document called Skills Discussion Questions in the Skills Training Folder. Meet as a group or, at minimum, in pairs to discuss the material and answer the questions each member developed. Continue this process for the first five chapters of the training manual. 4.1.0.2 Responsibilities At any given time, a total of three students can participate in the Monday night Skills Class with Jamie. One student is a co-leader, one student is a note-taker, and the last student is an observer. Co-leaders conduct mindfulness. Each week prepare a mindfulness that is emailed to Jamie by Sunday at 5:PM. Co-leaders write a practice agenda for the teaching portion of the class. You’ll be required to outline and submit a practice agenda based on your reading of the teaching manual. Co-leaders check on late clients and call clients who missed class with the exact HW from the week. Only the leader and co-leader participate and speak in class. The note-taker writes all the group notes (a single group note for the entire group and individual group notes for each participant). All student therapists complete the CLU DBT Skills Training Adherence Checklist. 4.2 Jamie’s Tips for Skills Training The following are general tips for the overall running of the DBT Skills Class. Specific tips for each module is located in the Google Drive. 4.2.1 General Tips If you purchased the books, the handouts and worksheets on PDF can be retreived at: Guilford Press. You’ll have to register with Guilford but it’s free. Managing time and setting the frame is important. Do your best to start and stop on time and make those decisions clear to the group prior to clients entering group. Be sure to let clients know that if they are late for class they are to wait in the waiting room and we will come and get them after mindfulness (~10-minutes into class) and after HW review (~40-Minutes into class) We often have snacks at break. Twizzlers, pretzels, and tea for some reason. Obviously this is optional. 4.2.2 Mindfulness Tips (5-10 Minutes) Be a leader of mindfulness. This means practice beforehand, have your script ready, and be confident and clear when you teach. Tell a story. Example: “I like hiking and this past weekend I was out for a hike on Mt. Hood. My friend came with me and really loves trees. I never noticed the differences between a Doug Fir, Cedar, or Spruce and had fun picking them out.” Have a clear objective. Example: “Today, I brought in pictures of a Doug Fir, Cedar, and Spruce. I’m going to pass them out and I want you to use your describe skills to notice and jot down any differences you see.” Remind about gentleness towards oneself. Example: “You may notice your mind wander to other areas of your life or to your neighbor. Do your best to notice that and come back to your task. The mind will wander. The best we can do is notice and bring it back to our goal. Make sense? Any questions?” Pro Tip: Do not pass out material unti you’re done with the instructions. They’ll be distracted! Ring bell and check-in. Example: “How was that?” “Did you notice your mind wander? Were you able to bring it back?” Don’t make it therapy. Move people along. Co-leader and Leader share too. Leader shares last. Leader: Resist the urge to comment on how it’s challenging to lead mindfulness while at the same time doing mindfulness. You could do this every session if you really think about it. 4.2.3 Practice (HW) Review Portion of Class Remind class what the practice was from last week. Ask for a volunteer to start. If Client did not complete practice: Complete a Missing Links Analysis (General Handout 8) Did you know what to do when you left? If yes, then proceed to next. When you left, did you plan doing it? If yes, then proceed to next. Did you remember? If yes, then proceed to next. What happened when you remembered? Does not have to be an aversive affair. Just see if you can figure out with some curiosity, interest, what got in the way. Ask if they used other skills they found helpful. I do this to find something to support and encourage. Be careful not to overly reinforce them. Always Try and Do the Following: Be behaviorally specific by highlighting thoughts, feelings, behaviors, or bodily senations Manage time. Know your stopping point. Co-leader can help. Keep an ear open for any practice that could lead to a discussion of destructive behavior. I say things such as: “Hold on one second, just checking but is this something that you can share with the group?” I sometimes start off practice (HW Review) with a reminder by saying: “Anybody have any practice that they want to share and that’s appropriate to share with the group?” The same can be said if a parent or kid starts to share about the other the party. You can say: “Hold on, This sounds like it’s about &lt;other person in room&gt;. Generally we avoid that in class. &lt;Other Person&gt;, do you know about this and is this okay for them to share? Generally, we want to avoid practice involving other people.” Common problems to keep an eye out for include: * Clients practice their skills in high SUDS situtations only * Clients do not write down their assignments High SUDs: Remind clients at the end of every class that they are to practice in low SUDs situations so they can master the skill first prior to using them in the most important situations in their lives. Improve HW Compliance: Give yourself enough time to help clients start the assignments at the end of class. 4.2.4 Teaching Portion of Class Orient Group to Handout: “Okay group, turn to Handout ##” Co-leader can walk around and make sure everyone is okay Provide a rationale for why clients would benefit from learning the skill. Typically done by connecting how the biosocial model fits with the skill being taught. “Have you ever noticed that…” Always have at least on hands-on practice in class and have multiple examples ready to go. Here’s where you can be creative and do your thing. The DBT Teaching Manual has great examples. Be behaviorally specific throughout When you validate, pay attention to the thought, feeling, or behavior and name it as such. Same when you make a correction. Give yourself enought time to assign HW. Know and plan to end with enough time to adequately cover HW and to troubleshoot what can get in the way. Ideally, get them started. “What is your plan?” “What can get in they way? I know you sometimes struggle to remember with your busy schedule. How will you manage that this week?” 4.2.5 Observations (Final 5-minutes) If the day was busy, chaotic, you can end with something relaxing or help them prepare for what to do after session Depending on class, you can give this 10-minutes if you really want to emphasize self-care after group Called a wrap around procedure. In the absence of problems we do observations: “Okay group, observations.” Clients can observe they were tired or that you’re wearing a blue shirt, etc. Leader goes last and should try to say something supportive or encouraging about the group as a whole. Something more “yoda” like than what we expect from the clients. 4.2.6 Google Drive for More Tips The Google Drive folder has additional tips for each module located in Skills Training and Jamie's Tips.

["supervision-and-dbt-team.html", "Section 5 Supervision and DBT Team 5.1 Individual Supervision 5.2 DBT Team Meetings", " Section 5 Supervision and DBT Team 5.1 Individual Supervision Have a written agenda for every supervision. Write it out before you come to supervision. Be prepared to discuss every client. Have one video prepared for discussion (know the date and time) of the moment you want to discuss. Please be on-time for supervision and wait in the Bell House reception area for Jamie to come and get you for supervision. You are required to have supervision every week. It’s your responsibility to schedule your time with Jamie. If you’re having phone supervsion then do not wait for Jamie to call. Call Jamie. 5.2 DBT Team Meetings Know your role for each week (i.e., leader, mindfulness, etc.). If you miss team, you owe the team a repair! Put yourself on the agenda for problem solving. Avoid updates! Put yourself on the agenda for burnout at least once a semester. Make an effort to contribute at least once to a discussion. "],

Women: Dress below the knees or pant suits. Modest tops. Cover all tattoos regardless of size. Clinic Policy and Staff. Treat the staff professionally. Know the rules and procedures for the clinic. If anything seems to contradict supervision then discuss with Jamie. Computer etiquette Log off from your computer and the recording system after each session. When writing notes, do not leave your computer unattended without logging off. Do not email anything about your clients with other providers or your supervisor (even if you use initials). Email or text Jamie: “Do you have a moment to chat about a client?” No need to say anything more. "]
