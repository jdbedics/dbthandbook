Review the logistics at the very beginning Set fee and require client to bring in proof of income Do not bring up or mention reduced fee option. Defer and say that you can talk to your suprvisor Collect Fee Remind them of 24-hour policy for missed sessions or they will be charged. Charges occur regardless the reason. If they have even a slightly itchy throat then they should cancel. Review confidentiality and privacy. Are they hoping their records will be used for anything in the future? Would they like for you to talk to someone important to them? Remind them they will complete the OQ before every session. Orient them and make sure they are set up with a userid and password. Help your client with this and they will have less difficulty completing it. Confirm the phone number on file and ask if you can leave a message on their phone if you have to call about logisitics. Remind them that you start at the top of the hour and sessions last 45-minutes. You can tell them that you manage time and will look at the clock and comment on time as you proceed. The goal is to make sure they are getting what they want out of the session and are covering everything they intended to have covered. 1.2 Continuing Sessions Start on-time and end on-time. Set the recording up early. Minimize the screen or turn of the monitor. You might have a therapist in the room before you that ends their sessions late. Ask them if they plan on continuing to do that in the future. If so, try to find another room. If there is no other room, or you’d rather not have that option, talk to the office staff. Do not fall behind on your notes more than one week. 1.3 Missed Session Call the number you confirmed to be the best number to reach them If a client misses a session, call and leave voicemail. Never say the clinic in a phone message unless the client said it’s okay. By default say “This is your first name calling. We had an appointment at 11:00AM. Since I didn’t hear from you in 24-hours, you’ll be charged with a miss session. You’ll be charged for two sessions the next time I see. Please call to confirm your next appointment by Friday at 5PM.” You might add: “If I don’t hear from by that time then I’ll assume you are no longer interested in treatment and I’ll close your file. You can always re-initiate treatment at anytime.” "],

Please do not view records or discuss cases with other providers. 3.1 Conversations It’s a natural urge to want to dicuss clients in the clinic. Please avoid doing so with your team and will other clinicians. The time for consultation is in supervision or on team. Consultation should be well thought out and purposively planned with a specific goal in mind. Check with Dr. Bedics first. General Tips Do not leave titanium unattended in any work area. Do not look in files that are not assigned to you. If you uncover protected health information (PHI), then do your best to protect the information and alert staff. Do not talk about your clients with other providers. If someone asks you about a client say: “Sorry, I can’t talk about my clients without consulting my supervisor”&quot; 3.2 Email and Printed material Never include your clients name in an email. Do not discuss your client in any detail in an email or text message. Instead, email or text that you’d like to talk about a client. Never take material relatd to the client outside of the office. 3.3 Phone Conversations When you call a client or if someone calls you about a client, you cannot confirm that you know the client without a release of information. Someone calls you: “I hear your concern, I cannot confirm that someone is or is not a client in the clinic and so I cannot respond to your questions. If you are concerned for safety, then I can provide general recommendations.” You call the client and someone else picks up: “Hi. Is there? No, no message. I’ll try again. I can’t say who this is but thank you. I’ll try again” It’s all incredibly awkward and is why it’s best to establish phone contact rules at the first session. 3.4 Client Requests that you Talk to other people (provider, family, etc.) Talk to Dr. Bedics Ask yourself what is the reason for the contact. What purpose woudl it serve? If you complete a release of information, specify what exactly you’d like to have accomplished and by what day/time. Always make clear that the release will expire after: a.) A certain goal is accomplished and/or b.) A certain time has passed by. "],

At the same time, in solving the problem we are vulnerable to saying or doing things that we could regret or make things worse. Highlights that the problem is valid. You’re upset for a reason.

["professionalism.html", "Section 6 Professionalism", " Section 6 Professionalism Don’t talk about your clients with people who have no responsibility in the care of your client Avoid getting roped into “water cooler” talk. It’s just best to not talk about clients outside of a formal setting Ask yourself, “Is this the appropriate setting to be talking about clients?” Dress appropriately. Men, no need for a tie and jacket Cover all tattoos regardless of size etc. Women, dress below the knees or pant suits. Modest tops. Computer etiquette Log off from your computer and the recording system. When writing notes, do not leave your computer unattended without logging off. Do not email anything about your clients with other providers or your supervisor (even if you use initials). For example, it’s common for a student to email/text their supervisor about client “SB” and provide a lengthy description of the circumstances. Solution: Email or text “Do you have a moment to chat about a client” "]
