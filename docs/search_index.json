Review the logistics at the very beginning Set fee and require client to bring in proof of income Do not bring up or mention reduced fee option. Defer and say that you can talk to your suprvisor Collect Fee Remind them of 24-hour policy for missed sessions or they will be charged. Charges occur regardless the reason. If they have even a slightly itchy throat then they should cancel. Review confidentiality and privacy. Are they hoping their records will be used for anything in the future? Would they like for you to talk to someone important to them? Remind them they will complete the OQ before every session. Orient them and make sure they are set up with a userid and password. Help your client with this and they will have less difficulty completing it. Confirm the phone number on file and ask if you can leave a message on their phone if you have to call about logisitics. Remind them that you start at the top of the hour and sessions last 45-minutes. You can tell them that you manage time and will look at the clock and comment on time as you proceed. The goal is to make sure they are getting what they want out of the session and are covering everything they intended to have covered. 1.2 Continuing Sessions Start on-time and end on-time. Set the recording up early. Minimize the screen or turn of the monitor. You might have a therapist in the room before you that ends their sessions late. Ask them if they plan on continuing to do that in the future. If so, try to find another room. If there is no other room, or you’d rather not have that option, talk to the office staff. Do not fall behind on your notes more than one week. "],

Phone Conversations", " Section 3 Contact with Internal and External Providers General Information: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your clients’ records. Please do not view records or discuss cases with other providers. 3.1 1. Conversations It’s a natural urge to want to dicuss clients in the clinic. Please avoid doing so with your team and will other clinicians. The time for consultation is in supervision or on team. General Tips Do not leave titanium unattended in any work area. Do not look in files that are not assigned to you. If you uncover protected health information (PHI), then do your best to protect the information and alert staff. Do not talk about your clients with other providers. If someone asks you about a client say: “Sorry, I can’t talk about my clients without consulting my supervisor”&quot; 3.2 2. Email and Printed material Never include your clients name in an email. Do not discuss your client in any detail in an email or text message. Instead, email or text that you’d like to talk about a client. Never take material relatd to the client outside of the office. 3.3 3. Phone Conversations When you call a client or if someone calls you about a client, you cannot confirm that you know the client without a release of information. Someone calls you: “I hear your concern, I cannot confirm that someone is or is not a client in the clinic.” You call the client and someone else picks up: “Hi. Is there? No, no message. I’ll try again. I can’t say who this is but thank you. I’ll try again” It’s all incredibly awkward and is why it’s best to establish phone contact rules at the first session. "],
