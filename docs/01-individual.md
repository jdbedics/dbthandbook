# Individual Therapy Session Tips

The following are some tips for the first and initial sessions for all clients. 

## First Session

1. Review Jamie's Safety Planning [Presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/jdbedics/clu-clinic-orientation-on-safety-planning).
2. Review the logistics at the very beginning
  * Set fee and require client to bring in proof of income
  * Do not bring up or mention reduced fee option.  Defer and say that you can talk to your suprvisor
  * Collect Fee
  * Remind them of 24-hour policy for missed sessions or they will be charged.  Charges occur regardless the reason.  If they have even a slightly itchy throat then they should cancel.
  * Review confidentiality and privacy.  Are they hoping their records will be used for anything in the future?  Would they like for you to talk to someone important to them?
  * Remind them they will complete the OQ before every session.  Orient them and make sure they are set up with a userid and password.  Help your client with this and they will have less difficulty completing it.
  * Confirm the phone number on file and ask if you can leave a message on their phone if you have to call about logisitics.
  * Remind them that you start at the top of the hour and sessions last 45-minutes.  You can tell them that you manage time and will look at the clock and comment on time as you proceed.  The goal is to make sure they are getting what they want out of the session and are covering everything they intended to have covered.

## Continuing Sessions

1. Start on-time and end on-time.
2. Set the recording up early.  Minimize the screen or turn of the monitor.
3. You might have a therapist in the room before you that ends their sessions late.  Ask them if they plan on continuing to do that in the future.  If so, try to find another room.  If there is no other room, or you'd rather not have that option, talk to the office staff.
4. Do not fall behind on your notes more than *one* week. 

## Missed Session

1. Call the number you confirmed to be the best number to reach them
2. If a client misses a session, call and leave voicemail.  
3. Never say the clinic in a phone message unless the client said it's okay.  
  * By default say “This is _your first name_ calling.  We had an appointment at 11:00AM.  Since I didn't hear from you in 24-hours, you'll be charged with a miss session.  You'll be charged for two sessions the next time I see.  Please call to confirm your next appointment by Friday at 5PM."
  * You might add: "If I don't hear from by that time then I'll assume you are no longer interested in treatment and I'll close your file.  You can always re-initiate treatment at anytime."
