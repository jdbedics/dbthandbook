<p>Participating in the DBT Skills Class with Jamie is a privilege. There is limited availability and it will add significantly to your workload. Below are your responsiblities:</p>
<p>At any given time, a total of three students can participate in the Monday Skills Class with Jamie.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Co-leaders always conduct mindfulness.
<ul>
<li>Each week prepare a mindfulness that is emailed to Jamie by Sunday at 5:PM.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Co-leaders always write an agenda for the teaching portion of the class.
<ul>
<li>You’ll be required to outline and submit a practice agenda based on your reading of the teaching manual.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Co-leaders check on late clients and call clients who missed with the exact HW from the week.</li>
<li>Only the leader and co-leader participate and speak in class.</li>
<li>The person waiting to become co-leader completes all the group notes (a single group note for the entire group and individual group notes for each participant.</li>
<li>All student therapists complete the CLU DBT Skills Training Adherence Checklist.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Jamie’s Tips for Skills Modules</h2>
<p>The following is content that can be included in the teaching portion of your class. Feel free to use any of the ideas in your agenda. The majority of material is taken directly from the teaching manual.</p>
<div id="general-tips" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> General Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If you purchased the boosk, the handouts and worksheets on PDF can be retreived at: <a href="www.guilford.com/skills-training-manual">Guilford</a>. You’ll have to register but it’s free.</p></li>
<li>Do your best to start and stop on time and make those decisions clear to the group prior to clients entering group.<br />
</li>
<li>Managing time and setting the frame is important.<br />
</li>
<li>If you know there will be challenges then it’s best to accommodate those challenges into the structure to the timeframe.<br />
</li>
<li>Hopefully, whatever changes are made to fit your setting is not too disruptive to the group.</li>
<li><p>We often have snacks at break. Twizzlers, pretzels, and tea for some reason. Obviously this is optional.</p></li>

<div id="mindfulness-tips-5-10-minutes" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Mindfulness Tips (5-10 Minutes)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tell a story</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Example: “I like hiking and this past weekend I was out for a hike on Mt. Hood.  My friend came with me and really loves trees.  I never noticed the differences between a Doug Fir, Cedar, or Spruce and had fun picking them out.”</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Have a clear objective</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Example: “Today, I brought in pictures of a Doug Fir, Cedar, and Spruce.  I’m going to pass them out and I want you to use your describe skills to notice and jot down any differences you see.” Don’t pass stimuli out until you’re done with the instructions.</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Remind about gentleness towards oneself</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Example: “You may notice your mind wander to other areas of your life or to your neighbor.  Do your best to notice that and come back to your task.  The mind will wander.  The best we can do is notice and bring it back to our goal. Make sense? Any questions?”</code> Pass out material.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ring bell and check-in.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Example: “How was that?” “Did you notice your mind wander? Were you able to bring it back?”</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t make it therapy. Move people along. Co-leader and Leader share too. Leader shares last. Resist the urge to comment on how it’s challenging to lead mindfulness while at the same time doing mindfulness. You could do this every session if you really think about it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="practice-hw-review-portion-of-class" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Practice (HW) Review Portion of Class</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remind class what the practice was from last week.</li>
<li>Ask for a volunteer to start.</li>
</ul>
<p>Client did not complete practice</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing Links Analysis (General Handout 8)
<ul>
<li>Did you know what to do when you left? If yes, then proceed to next.</li>
<li>When you left, did you plan doing it? If yes, then proceed to next.</li>
<li>Did you remember? If yes, then proceed to next.</li>
<li>What happened when you remembered?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Doesn’t have to be an aversive affair. Just see if you can figure out with some curiosity, interest, what got in the way.</p>
<p>Ask if they used other skills they found helpful. I do this to find something to support and encourage. Be careful to reinforce not doing HW (which means completing the Worksheet)</p>
<ul>
<li>Be behaviorally specific</li>
<li>Positively reinforce specific behaviors and clearly separate thoughts, urges, feelings, behaviors.</li>
<li>Manage time. Know your stopping point.
<ul>
<li>Co-leader can help here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keep an ear open for any practice that could lead to a discussion of destructive behavior.</li>
<li>I say things such as <code>“Hold on one second, just checking but is this something that you can share with the group?”</code></li>
<li>I sometimes start off practice by saying, <code>“Anybody have any practice that they want to share and that’s appropriate to share with the group?”</code>
<ul>
<li>Just a constant reminder that they can’t share everything in group</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The same can be said if a parent or kid starts to share about the other the party. You can say: <code>“Hold on, This sounds like it’s about the X (other person in room).  Generally we avoid that in class.  X, do you know about this and is this okay?”</code></li>
<li>You can proceed but remind them not to do that b/c you’re reinforcing it by proceeding this first time.</li>
<li>All of this is much more successfully if you clearly told the clients prior to them even starting group what they can and cannot say with the rationale that we want to do everything we can to facilitate learning and reduce upsetting emotions that could get in they way of learning.
<ul>
<li>Clients slip, of course, but I’ve never had a problem as long as I’ve explained this rationale early.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="teaching-portion-of-class" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> Teaching Portion of Class</h3>
<ul>
<li>Orient Group to Handout <code>“Okay group, turn to Handout ##”</code></li>
<li>Co-leader can walk around and make sure everyone is okay Why mention this obvious point? Balance too much time versus too little time I’ve seen both extremes and most imbalances are due to therapist anxiety.</li>
</ul>
<p>Know and demonstrate a knowledge of your audience. Typically done by connecting how the biosocial model fits with the skill being taught “Have you ever noticed that…” You can be creative here and also use DBT Teaching Manual.</p>
<p>Practice in class and have multiple examples ready Here’s where you can be creative and do your thing. The DBT Teaching Manual has great examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be behaviorally specific.
<ul>
<li>When you validate, just pay attention to the thought, feeling, or behavior and name it as such.</li>
<li>Same when you make a correction</li>
<li>Most of the time you’re doing both but be aware of the balance during any given session or with any particular client.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Manage time effectively.</li>
<li>Start and end on time.</li>
<li>Know and plan to end with enough time to adequately cover HW and to troubleshoot what can get in the way Ideally, get them started. <code>“What is your plan?”</code> <code>“What can get in they way?  I know you sometimes struggle to remember with your busy schedule.  How will you manage that this week?”</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="observations-final-5-minutes" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.5</span> Observations (final 5-minutes)</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the day was busy, chaotic, you can end with something relaxing or help them prepare for what to do after session</li>
<li>Depending on class, you can give this 10-minutes if you really want to emphasize self-care after group
<ul>
<li>Called a WRAP around procedure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the absence of problems <code>“Okay group, observations.”</code></li>
<li>Clients can observe they were tired or that you’re wearing a blue shirt, etc.</li>
<li>Leader goes last and should try to say something supportive or encouraging about the group as a whole. Something more “yoda” like than what we expect from the clients.</li>
<li>Co-leader can do whatever but makes sense to have something in the middle.</li>
</ul>
