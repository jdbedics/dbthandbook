<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> General Clinic</h2>
<p>Unless you’re told otherwise by Dr. Bedics, all of your clients are general clinic clients and <em>not</em> in DBT. They are simply being seen under the umbrella of the DBT Clinic at CLU. They are receiving behavioral therapy and you are being supervised in behavior therapy as you learned it in the Spring Behavior Therapy class (PSYD 745).</p>
</div>
<div id="general-procedures-and-professionalism" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> General Procedures and professionalism</h2>
<p>Your performance and evaluation in the practicum is largely a reflection of your professionalism.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Be on time for all appointments.</li>
<li>End all appointments on time, :45 past the hour, which means wind down at :40.</li>
<li>Be aware of all clinic policies and procedures. If you notice anything discrepant between the clinic and Dr. Bedics, then email Dr. Bedics.</li>
<li>Be polite and respectful to all staff.</li>
<li>Do not talk about clients with other providers in an open setting.</li>
<li>Do not leave Titanium unattended.</li>
<li>Never take any information with a client’s name or other PHI outside of the clinc. Ever.</li>
<li>Do not email or text Dr. Bedics with a client’s name. Ever.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="first-session-checklist" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> First Session Checklist</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Review Jamie’s Safety Planning <strong><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jdbedics/clu-clinic-orientation-on-safety-planning">Presentation</a></strong> before meeting with client. Conduct safety planning as needed.
<ul>
<li>Always carry the <em>essential sheets</em> with you to every session.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Checklist: [ ] If not done already, set fee. Ask client to bring in proof of income. [ ] Do not bring up or mention reduced fee option. If asked, ask the reason and tell them that you will talk to your supervisor. [ ] If you’re collecting the fee remember to always collect the fee at the beginning of session. [ ] Remind them of 24-hour policy for missed sessions or they will be charged. Charges occur regardless the reason. I often tell them if they have any reason to believe they will miss then call and cancel. [ ] Review confidentiality and privacy.<br />
[ ] Ask if they are hoping their records will be used for anything in the future. [ ] Ask if they would like for you to talk to someone important to them about their treatment. [ ] Orient them to the OQ and help make it easy for them. [ ] Confirm the phone number on file and ask if you can leave a message on their phone if you have to call about logisitics. [ ] Remind them that you start at the top of the hour and sessions last 45-minutes. You can tell them that you manage time and will look at the clock and comment on time as you proceed. The goal is to make sure they are getting what they want out of the session and are covering everything they intended to have covered. [ ] Orient to behavior therapy. Tell the client that you conduct short-term problem solving therapy. Sessions range from 8-10 weeks. If the client would like to renew they can but they can expect to <em>graduate</em> in approximately 2-months (provide them with date). You can validate that this is likely different from their expectations or therapy they have had in the past. The first few sessions involve getting to know each other and see what can be accomplished. After several sessions, you and client will agree on termination/renewal time. [ ] Complete the DBT General Note and start drafting the treatment plan using the CLU template on Titanium.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students should feel free to save this document as a PDF and print this page out for each new client.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You’re allowed to take written notes, use a clipboard, and write on the white board during all sessions. By default, use these methods sparingly and only as a means to help you engage the client in the spirit of problem solving.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="continuing-sessions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Continuing Sessions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Set the recording up early. Minimize the screen <strong>and</strong> turn the monitor off.</li>
<li>Do not start the session until your client completes the OQ.
<ul>
<li>Help your client become successful at completing the OQ. Support and encourage and help them remember <em>how</em> to do it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You might have a therapist in the room before you that ends their sessions late. Ask them if they plan on continuing to do that in the future. If so, try to find another room. If there is no other room, or you’d rather not have that option, talk to clinic staff, the clinic director, or Dr. Bedics.</li>
<li>Complete all notes within <em>one</em> week.</li>
<li>Use the DBT General Note for individual sessions. This is the standard note for your clients when you are supervised by Jamie.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="setting-goals" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Setting Goals</h2>
<p>It is not your clients job to come into session with goals. Instead, listen to your clients’ concerns and attempt to make them into solvable problems. You never have to use the term <em>goal</em> or ever ask your client <em>What’s you’re goal</em>? The goals naturally reveal themselves as you listen to what’s on your client’s mind. It is your job to rephrase their statements into something like:</p>
<pre><code>`It sounds like there are times when it&#39;s really hard for you to say no? Do you think that would be helpful for us to get our heads around and come up with some solutions?`</code></pre>
<p>Dr. Bedics rarely uses the term <em>goal</em>, instead the therapists job is to come up with tangible outcomes that can demonstrated after 8-10 sessions. These goals are fluid and always developing or being revised. It is the therapists job to pay careful attention, keep the session organized, and maintain awareness of progress.</p>
</div>
<div id="termination-of-treatment" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Termination of Treatment</h2>
<p>As a default, tell you’re client that you conduct short-term problem solving therapy. Sessions last between 8-10 sessions with an option to renew. The fr</p>
<ul>
<li>After 2-3 sessions, let your client know you’re plan for intervention along with a timeline for termination.
<ul>
<li>If you’re not following an exact protocol then I often make a fairly aribtrary timeline. For example, if we start on Sept 1st then I’ll set a time to end right before Thanksgiving.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let your client know that treatment will be reassessed at that point and could be extended if the client would like to address additional areas.</li>
<li>When there is a a month left in treatment, remind the client every session that treatment is ending in order to focus your time.</li>
<li>In <em>DBT only</em>, discuss the concept of ex-therapist for life.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="missed-individual-sessions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Missed Individual Sessions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If a client misses a session, call and leave a voicemail following the guidelines in the section on <a href="phone-contact-with-clients.html">phone contact</a>.</li>
