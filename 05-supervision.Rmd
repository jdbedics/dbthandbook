# Supervision and DBT Team

## Individual Supervision

1. Have a written agenda for every supervision. Write it out *before* you come to supervision.
2. Cover every client even if it's an update. Do <strong>not</strong> make them all updates.
3. Have one video prepared for discussion (know the date and time)

*You are required to have supervision every week and it's your responsibility to schedule it with Jamie.*

*If you're having phone supervsion, do not wait for Jamie to call.  Call Jamie.*


## DBT Team Meetings

1. Keep an updated schedule for every team so that you know you're role for that week.
2. Be on time!
3. If you miss team, you owe the team a repair!
4. Put yourself on the agenda for problem solving and come prepared with a question each week (even though Jamie answered everything in supervision)
5. Put yourself on the agenda for burnout at least once a semester.
